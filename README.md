# UPDATE

It has been over 2+ months since I last used this program, it has a ton of bugs that occur when trying to download large videos (Usually over 30 minutes) Please use at your own discretion and don't complain if it no longer works, thanks <3

# Simple YouTube Downloader & MP3 Converter

This was made when I got my new phone because I needed to download music and all the current online Converters suck. I used two libraries 'Libvideo' & 'MediaToolkit'.

This software is in no finished or completely bug free, its far from it actually. This was just made to be used by me. I thought I should just make it public anyway though.

## Explanation
> Add Link will add the current link into the ListBox

> Clear List will completely wipe the ListBox

> Remove Last will remove the last input.

> Download All will download all the songs in the list.

> "Delete .MP4" will remove the .mp4 file from your computer after it is done converting it to an .mp3


## Features
> Download .MP4 Videos

> Convert .MP4 to .MP3 Format 

> Allows you to delete the .MP4 file after conversion
